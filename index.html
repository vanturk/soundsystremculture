					whose work has shaped music, literature, and community engagement for decades. As founders of Sound
					System Culture and the Listen & Be Heard Network, they are dedicated to empowering diverse
					communities through the arts, fostering cross-cultural dialogue, and supporting emerging talent.</p>


				<h3 class="padding-top-64">Jay Rodriguez-Sierra: Acclaimed Musician and Artistic Director</h3>
				<p>Jay Rodriguez is a Grammy-nominated composer, producer, and internationally recognized virtuoso
					multi-instrumentalist. His musical career spans over forty years, during which he has played an

					artistic innovation and social impact.</p>

				<h3 class="padding-top-64">Martha Cinader: Poet, Author, and Multimedia Producer</h3>

				<p>Martha Cinader is a poet, author, and multimedia producer whose creative path began within the
					dynamic spoken word and music scenes of 1980s and 1990s New York City. She is the author of two
					books of poetry and short . Her single "Living It!", has been released on multiple compilations
					around the world including Universal Music France and Switzerland. She has performed at prestigious
					venues and festivals, including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Panasonic Village Jazz Festival,

					forthcoming young adult novel, Marq and the Queen Fish, is scheduled for publication in 2026.</p>
				<p>Martha is the founder and Director of the Listen & Be Heard Network, what began as a unique and
					popular open mic event in the East Village, became a weekly arts newspaper and poetry cafe in the
					Bay Area of California for six years and is, in its current iteration, a producer of non-commercial
					podcasts and radio shows syndicated on the Pacifica Affiliate Network, such as The Listen & Be Heard
					Hour and Beyond Borders. Her body of work encompasses live radio dramas, arts journalism, and
					community storytelling, with deep roots in iconic venues like the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, University
					of the Streets, and collaborations with Steve Cannon at A Gathering of the Tribes.</p>

					Community Engagement</h3>

					providing a platform and voice for a shared vision. Together, Martha Cinader and Jay
					Rodriguez-Sierra champion artistic expression, education, and cultural preservation. Their
					collaborative efforts set groundbreaking standards as performing artists and creators.</p>
				<p>In addition to their artistic achievements, they mentor emerging artists, produce transformative
